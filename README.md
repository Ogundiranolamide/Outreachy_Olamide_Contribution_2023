#### **`Introduction:`**

The Congo Basin forest ecoregion (Olson and Dinerstein, 2002) is comprised of tropical forests in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Republic of Congo (ROC), Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, and a small portion of Angola (Fig. 1). This represents the largest connected tract of forest in Africa, and the single largest peatland complex in the world, storing a significant amount of forest carbon [Dargie et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20312085#b0075)

The basin is highly biodiverse and is a focus of recent species discovery [Dargie et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20312085#b0065), [Hart et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20312085#b0135), while more than 30 million people inhabit the basin, including indigenous communities with a long and intricate relationship to natural ecosystems [Riddell, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20312085#b0300). Together these characteristics represent a unique ecological opportunity to mitigate climate, while supporting the livelihoods of the many communities who depend on essential natural resources. 

The relative lack of current geo-spatial information on forests, and few validation information from the ground due to lack of access or security, political instability; or widely distributed studies on land-use related impacts on forests and associated species biodiversity, for example in compared to the Amazon basin or Asian forests currently hinders successful management and conservation efforts in the context of needed sustainable development [Malhi et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20312085#b0195).

The Congo Basin rainforest is the second-largest in the world, covering almost 200 million ha of humid tropical forest. It plays a crucial role in the global climate cycle and provides local livelihoods and resources for more than 100 million people across six countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo (Somorin et al [2012](https://www.researchgate.net/?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QifX0#)). Despite its importance, forest dynamics in the Congo Basin remain understudied compared to those in Amazon and Southeast Asian rainforests, and it is only recently that scientists have begun to systematically evaluate how and why Congo Basin forests are changing (Tyukavina et al [2018](https://www.researchgate.net/?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QifX0#), Creese et al [2019](https://www.researchgate.net/?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QifX0#), Kleinschroth et al [2019](https://www.researchgate.net/?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QifX0#)).The rapidly growing population in the Congo Basin has led to an acceleration of forest disturb-ance rates over the past decades, with an estimated 16 million ha of forest cleared between 2000 and 2014 (Tyukavina et al [2018](https://www.researchgate.net/?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QifX0#)). Smallholder agricul-ture causes the large majority of forest disturbances. Other major drivers include selective logging, mining, and road expansion (Potapov et al [2012](https://www.researchgate.net/?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QifX0#), Tyukavina et al [2018](https://www.researchgate.net/?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QifX0#), Umunay et al [2019](https://www.researchgate.net/?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7InBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiIsInByZXZpb3VzUGFnZSI6Il9kaXJlY3QifX0#)).

#### **`Landmass:`**

>The Congo Basin makes up one of the most important wilderness areas left on Earth. At 500 million acres, it is larger than the state of Alaska and stands as the world’s second-largest tropical forest. There are approximately 10, 000 species of tropical plants in the Congo Basin and 30 percent are unique to the region. Endangered wildlife, including forest elephants, chimpanzees, bonobos, and lowland and mountain gorillas inhabit the lush forests. 400 other species of mammals, 1,000 species of birds and 700 species of fish can also be found here.
The Congo Basin has been inhabited by humans for more than 50,000 years and it provides food, fresh water and shelter to more than 75 million people. Nearly 150 distinct ethnic groups exist and the region’s Ba’Aka people are among the most well known representatives of an ancient hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Their lives and well-being are linked intimately with the forest.

#### **`Threats:`**

>A large and growing percentage of the Congo Basin is under concession to logging and mining companies. Such industries bring large groups of people to the forest and with that come their need for food, including bushmeat and fuelwood. Related infrastructure projects such as roads and dams have environmental impacts and increase access to remote forest areas for hunters.
The leading cause of wildlife loss in the Congo Basin is the commercial bushmeat trade, driven by an ever increasing market. In the DRC alone, over a million tons of bushmeat are consumed each year. Alarmingly, this lucrative business is causing the forest to become empty of species. Animals like monkeys and antelope are common targets, although species such as gorillas and bonobos are also at risk.
